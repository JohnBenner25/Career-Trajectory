Using a historical baseball dataset, we were able to regress on base + slugging (a baseball statistic for hitters commonly referred to as OPS) on age to create a playerâ€™s career trajectory and map it graphically. We were then able to compare that trajectory to players across the history of baseball in terms of peak OPS and playing career. We each selected an individual baseball player, and I selected Ryan Zimmerman, former Washington National. I filtered data to only select players at the same position and was able to determine the player that had the most similar career to Ryan Zimmerman, which was determined to be Evan Longoria, former 3rd Baseman for the Tampa Bay Rays.
